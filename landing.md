DIY new/customized patterns

* Links from the galleries above lead to the following pages. These pages are currently under construction.
  The links still go to the [all-in-one](/GroundForge/tiles) page, sometimes via the [print/pdf](/GroundForge/print) friendly page
  * play with [stitches and threads](/GroundForge/stitches?whiting=C17_P132&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&c1=ctctttt&a1=ctctttt&d2=ctctttt&c3=ctctttt&a3=ctctttt&b4=ctctttt&patch=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--;brick&tile=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--&tileStitch=ctctttt&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4)
    (_under construction, diagrams section of the all-in-one page_)
  * modify the [pair diagrams](/GroundForge/pattern?whiting=C17_P132&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&c1=ctctttt&a1=ctctttt&d2=ctctttt&c3=ctctttt&a3=ctctttt&b4=ctctttt&patch=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--;brick&tile=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--&tileStitch=ctctttt&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4)
    (_under construction, pattern section of the all-in-one page_)
  * use thread diagrams as pair diagrams (_under construction_): [Droste effect](/GroundForge/pattern?whiting=C17_P132&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&c1=ctctttt&a1=ctctttt&d2=ctctttt&c3=ctctttt&a3=ctctttt&b4=ctctttt&patch=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--;brick&tile=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--&tileStitch=ctctttt&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4)
* create patterns with
  * [mirrored and rotated](/GroundForge/symmetry) repeats (no transformation to pair diagrams)
  * Free [tile](/GroundForge/pattern?whiting=C17_P132&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&c1=ctctttt&a1=ctctttt&d2=ctctttt&c3=ctctttt&a3=ctctttt&b4=ctctttt&patch=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--;brick&tile=L-O-,---5,H-E-,-5--&tileStitch=ctctttt&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4) boundaries
* move pin positions
  * see: prickings - downloadable - pair diagrams DIY
  * to be developed tutorials for other diagrams and inkscape plugins

Prickings
---------

* plugins for Inkscape (a 3rd party editor)
    * [installation](/inkscape-bobbinlace/)
    * dotted grids ([regular](/inkscape-bobbinlace/Regular-Grids) / [polar](/inkscape-bobbinlace/Polar-Grids) )
    * pair diagrams [regular / polar](/inkscape-bobbinlace/Ground-from-Template)
* downloadable (for any 3rd party vector based editor)
    * [polar](/polar-grids/) dotted grids
    * pair diagrams (the whole swatch changes when changing a single repeat, the dance leader)
        * follow SVG links from [tesselace](/tesselace-to-gf/) pages, download and adjust angle and/or pin positions
        * DIY based on this url example
          ```
          https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/sheet.html?patch=5-M9,-50F;checker
          ```  
          _to be explained somewhere else_:  
          value for `patch` is `tile` value of other urls  
          `checker` can also be `brick` (note that patterns may have other tilings)

History of D-BL and GroundForge
===============================

D-BL started as DiBL under google-code. By the time that google-code discontinued,
an account by the name dibl was already taken and the _i_ replaced by a dash.

The polar grids were exercises to master new technology.

Timeline
--------

* **end of 2001**:  
  The first release for [flanders](/flanders/) thread diagrams
* **before 2008**:  
  A [desktop application](https://github.com/d-bl/bobbinwork/wiki)
  with a few more traditional grounds, each predefined with a tedious process and some custom XML.
  This had a textual tree view of the diagrams, drilling down from spider to stitches to cross/twist.
* **2013**: 
  * Discovery of PhD research in progress that lead to [tesselace](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127125331/https://tesselace.com/)
  * Redesign using SVG, a combination of a [web application](/DiBL/grounds/index.html) and inkscape plugins  
    this allowed again more patterns but still had a limited choice of stitches 
* **fall 2015**:  
  Proof of concept with [force graphs](#glossary),
  Inspiration for this [cheat-sheet](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template.png).  
  Both reduced the burden of complex GUIs with file IO and parsing complex data structures.
* **2017**:
  * Discovery of Jo Edkins' [index](http://www.theedkins.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/index.htm)
    on an out-of-copyright book, the [sampler](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/collection-insights/2018/gertrude-whiting-bobbin-lace-sampler)
    by Gertrude Whiting.
  * Request for a guinea pig to review GroundForge.
  * Discovery of the Droste effect: using thread diagrams as pair diagrams.
* **January 2018**
  * More tile configurations than bricks and bathroom.
* **Mid 2019**:
  * Extended the cheat sheet for longer lines between stitches.
* **August 2021**:
  * tutorials for a workshop at IOLI UnConn 2.0 hosted by _the lace museum_
  * birth of the nets page
* **May 2022**:
  birth of the pdf/print friendly page
* **January 2023**:
  birth of the symmetry page,  
  it needs redevelopment from scratch to translate the pair diagrams into thread diagrams
